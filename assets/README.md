# Coding Quiz

## About The Project
This website was created to provide you with a JavaScript quiz to test your knowledge about things related to JavaScript. The quiz has 10 questions that will appear in random order each time the quiz is started and you will have 100 seconds to complete the quiz. Each question you get wrong will result in 10 points being deducted from your final score as well as 10 seconds being reduced from your overall time to complete this quiz. Once the quiz is finished you will be given a score and can provide your initials to save your score to be apart of the high scores list. Visit your highscores by clicking on the "View High Scores" at the top left of the website. You may also clear your high score data if you wish by clicking on the "clear high scores" button. Good luck!
